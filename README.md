# etch-a-sketch

A fun etch a sketch app made using vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. This app is not mobile compatible but is lots of un in the browser. 

You can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to draw a sketch or click and drag on the canvas with the mouse pointer. There is a button to make big or small pixels, and a button to clear the canvas to start a new drawing.
